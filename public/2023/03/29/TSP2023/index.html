    <p>Just like last year, I got the amazing opportunity to take part in The Speed Project (TSP). It‚Äôs a roughly 300-mile unsanctioned relay race from LA to Las Vegas. All of the high-level details are covered in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.limchayseng.com/2022/03/30/TSP2022/">last year‚Äôs post</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.limchayseng.com/2022/03/10/up-next/r">here</a>. The 2022 post was very long because of so many new and different feelings that come from this race and an experience like TSP. This year was nothing different, but I‚Äôm going (to try) to keep things a bit more succinct this year.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll follow a similar recap breakdown of:</p>

<h3 id="Team-Breakdown"><a href="#Team-Breakdown" class="headerlink" title="Team Breakdown"></a>Team Breakdown</h3><p>We had a team of 7 this year - one more than last year. Ross (our captain), Val, Dani, Anthony, and I were the returning squad. New to the team were Abby, Anna, and Toan. We also had a new support crew which included the biggest names in the Equinox scene: Rene and Jenn.</p>
<p>I really loved our team last year and figured it would be tough to have a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù experience. One of the most addicting things about this race is how it allows you to form really close connections with the people that you spend all that time with. This year proved that again with new people and new stories and new connections. I tried not to have any expectations in terms of altered team dynamics, but even so, I was blown away by how amazing and strong our group was and how well we operated together.</p>
<p>Just like Jane last year, Jenn and Rene were the unsung MVPs of the entire team. They held our team together through the inevitable mental breakdowns, sleep deprivation, and obstacles that go on throughout the days. I‚Äôll talk about that more in the Top Moments section.</p>

<h3 id="Personal-Race-Effort-‚ÄúI-didn‚Äôt-save-anything-for-the-swim-back‚Äù"><a href="#Personal-Race-Effort-‚ÄúI-didn‚Äôt-save-anything-for-the-swim-back‚Äù" class="headerlink" title="Personal Race Effort - ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt save anything for the swim back‚Äù"></a>Personal Race Effort - ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt save anything for the swim back‚Äù</h3><p>Last year I had some more specific goals, but this year I tried to keep it simple. I wanted to push myself to the edge of what I thought I could handle by hammering every single run and ultimately do better than last year.</p>
<p>Since last year was my first year, I tried to be a bit conservative because I didn‚Äôt know how my body would handle the volume and intensity. This time, I had a better idea of what I could handle and I knew I could at least finish, so I wanted to run myself into the ground with every opportunity I had and leave nothing for the end. Last year I was able to finish really strong (which was somewhat part of the plan), but this year I actually wanted to limp across the finish line knowing I‚Äôd given it everything and left it all in the desert.</p>
<p>Last year, I ran 44.6 miles with an average of 6:55 min&#x2F;mile.</p>
<p>This year I ran 49.23 miles with an average of 6:46 min&#x2F;mile.</p>
<p>I was really happy with this improvement of being able to shave a full 9 sec off the average pace (essentially hitting my goal marathon pace for Boston over the 5.5 total hours of running) and even over more miles than last year. I gave everything to the team and to the race and even fought through some really painful Achilles issues in the last few segments. I could‚Äôve done even better I think if I didn‚Äôt have that injury, but it was a clear marker that I really did push myself to the edge and I was literally limping at the finish line‚Ä¶ so mission accomplished.</p>
<p>I felt like I hit my goal and have no regrets about how I ran the race.

Ross was the most badass captain of our squad once again, Dani held everything down as another diligent team leader, Val fought through a meniscus tear to blow away expectations, and Anthony crushed all his segments with fast paces. They already know how I feel about them.</em></p>
<p>Our new crew members and teammates each brought incredible things to this year‚Äôs race. They made this year exceptional and getting to spend time with them to learn more about them honestly stood out as the highlight more than any actual running or racing aspect of the experience.</p>
<p><em>Rene</em>:</p>
<img src="/2023/03/29/TSP2023/rene_2023.png" class="" title="Rene">
<p>I first got to witness Rene‚Äôs unmatched energy in an equinox cycling class back in 2018. His energy is like no other person I‚Äôve ever met and it‚Äôs like a super magnet for bringing people together and bringing out the best in people. When I heard he‚Äôd be part of the squad, I was so interested to see how that energy I witnessed at Equinox would translate to leading our team in the desert. He became the glue for our entire squad. He was the force that made us want to work harder for him, for ourselves, and for the team. His positivity and energy were unmatched and I know that our entire team performed at an entirely different level because of him. Of all of the people I‚Äôve met in my life, he stands out to me as one of the best role models for how to really make a positive and electric impact on the people and the environment around you.</p>
<p><em>Jenn</em></p>
<img src="/2023/03/29/TSP2023/jenn_2023.png" class="" title="Jenn and Ethan">
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/vspicturescom/">Photo by @vsphotoscom</a></p>
<p>In a similar way, Jenn brought the entire team to the next level. She was in charge of managing the RV, which is one of the hardest tasks of the entire race. I said it last year: no matter how fast you run, if your RV or team is in the wrong place, it means nothing. Jenn made one of the biggest race-defining moves during the last 20 miles of the race. In a new and unknown segment of the race that we didn‚Äôt run last year, she made a call to pull off of an unpaved path to get back to the freeway and try to beat us to the next meet-up spot. If she continued on the designated route per the plan, it‚Äôs likely the RV would‚Äôve gotten stuck (since we ran by 2 others that ended up stuck). By thinking on her feet and making a big-time call, she ended up saving that last segment of the race and likely avoided adding hours to our finish time. She was our quarterback that was able to make the critical decisions and keep us in check and humbled‚Ä¶ all while being the most empathetic and compassionate member of the team to make sure every person was surviving. She was able to exceed in her role all while putting herself second to the entire team, which makes her another incredible leader and role model.</p>
<p><em>Abby</em></p>
<img src="/2023/03/29/TSP2023/abby_2023.png" class="" title="Abby">
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/vspicturescom/">Photo by @vsphotoscom</a></p>
<p>I mentioned in last year‚Äôs post how I get to meet some of the most strong and most positive people through endurance events like TSP. I got to spend a lot of time running with Abby since we were in the same squad&#x2F;rotations. Abby raised that bar in the way that she: handled the obstacles we all faced with unrelenting positivity, persevered through personal pain to perform for the team, and brought out authentic joy from every single person on our team. She took what could‚Äôve been the darkest and hardest moments of the race and made them feel like a fun run. She stands out as another new role model on how to bring out something amazing in people and make life just ‚Äúbetter‚Äù by being there. She also had the incredible talent of being able to make us all feel valued through her empathy and humor. She treated each person on our team like she‚Äôd known them for years and brought our team closer every minute we were all together.</p>
<p><em>Toan</em></p>
<img src="/2023/03/29/TSP2023/toan_2023.png" class="" title="Toan">
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/vspicturescom/">Photo by @vsphotoscom</a></p>
<p>I sadly didn‚Äôt get to spend enough time during the race with Toan, but this guy was one of the most real out there. He was ridiculously motivated and driven not only to perform like a workhorse runner and teammate but to make the experience better for the group. I got to see how he lifted up all of our team members through his words and actions. It was really cool to see someone who, while so invested in giving his all and succeeding himself, was able to also prioritize the success of others around him. I never once heard him brag about what he was accomplishing, only hyping up and bragging for others. I learned some really awesome things from him in our short time together and through time celebrating in Vegas together. I can‚Äôt wait to see how much he succeeds in the running community and crushing all of the goals he‚Äôs set.</p>
<p><em>Anna</em></p>
<img src="/2023/03/29/TSP2023/anna_2023.png" class="" title="Anna">
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/vspicturescom/">Photo by @vsphotoscom</a></p>
<p>Because of the split-up running groups, I didn‚Äôt get to spend too much time with Anna during the race, but I have huge respect for her. I got to see how she helped our entire team improve because of her deep experience with 5 years of TSP. I think she was probably the most consistent runner that always hit her paces and was the exemplar of how to race smart. She became a leader on our team to help keep us all in check and organized. She was the humble bedrock that was the foundation of the success of our team and acted as a platform for the rest of us to make mistakes and take risks - another true workhorse of the team.</p>
<h4 id="That-Finish-Line-Feeling"><a href="#That-Finish-Line-Feeling" class="headerlink" title="That Finish Line Feeling"></a>That Finish Line Feeling</h4><p>An interesting reflection comparing this year to last year was how I felt at the end. Last year, I was delirious. I couldn‚Äôt think straight, my stomach hurt, my legs were shot, and I was somewhat mentally broken for a few hours.</p>
<p>This year, I felt pretty good. I was able to run stronger and smarter throughout the whole race, and I ended the race in a really positive mental space. I was able to take everything in a bit more.</p>
<p>I think it comes partly from having a previous TSP experience, but more from growing as a person and athlete through these events. One of the best parts about doing this race, and doing it multiple times, is to be able to clearly witness personal growth. My finish line feeling helped me realize how far I‚Äôve come and how different I‚Äôve become since arriving at the Vegas sign in 2022.</p>
<p>Like I‚Äôve said before, most of that growth I really credit to the community of people around me in Chicago and across the US. I‚Äôm grateful to the TSP team this year plus all the friends in my life for the way we can all push each other to be better in running, racing, and in life as a whole.</p>
<p>Life is nothing without growth.</p>

<h3 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h3><p>If it‚Äôs not apparent, my biggest reflections this year are about the power of connection between the people that take part in TSP.</p>
<p>This year, running wasn‚Äôt really the priority or thing I thought about the most. I think TSP provides this insane opportunity to forge new connections and friendships unlike anything else I‚Äôve done. I appreciated that aspect much more this year and tried to take all of that in along with the actual race. Ripping through desert landscapes is cool, but there‚Äôs nothing like building new relationships. ‚úåüèº</p>
