# Starting this Blog 

As an effort to start exploring a bit more of my creative side, I've decided to start this blog with the following goals: 

1. Explore a little more of my creative side and work on my writing skills 
2. Push my technical skills I use everyday such as networking, web development, and new software tech
3. Publish and share any research and findings I have through my projects 
4. Integrate my fitness/running/cycling passion into all of the above to generate some hopefully interesting content 

Looking forward to see how this will develop!
