Due to this blog, I've tried to be more aware of the thoughts that come and go throughout a run, and I've realized that there's a reoccurring thought that happens during every run, usually multiple times a run. I picture myself running the Ventura Marathon. I try to take the discomfort and the strain I'm feeling in this moment and think about how I'll feel those same things during the marathon. I try to anticipate how I will handle those impulses... Will I want to stop? Will my mind force my body to slow down? Can I override that uncomfortable feeling?

Along with transposing that discomfort to my "vision" of myself running the Ventura Marathon, I also try to think about what it will feel like to cross the finish line. I think of what it will feel like at the final straightaway. There are a few scenarios that could happen, and all of them terrify me. I'm guessing I'll either finish strong and realize I'm on track to beat my goal and push my hardest to sink my time as far below 2:55. Maybe I'll be right on track with my goal, and I'll push my hardest to ensure I hit 2:55. Or, I'll have already missed my time and be pushing through pain to try to make the most of the situation.

Whatever the scenario, I know there will be an intense amount of pain and stress, even if I have to hobble across the finish line. That certainty is scary, and I think I've become obsessed with trying to accept and prepare for it.

During the race, I think that entire mindset will shift to focus on the "now," and simply focus on getting to the next mile in time, and putting one foot in front of the other.

I'm confident about my goal and feel good about my health and mental readiness to make this sub-3 hour attempt. I'm done being consumed, and I'm ready to execute. ðŸ’€
