Hi my name is Ethan.

As mentioned on the front page, I've started this blog to help myself solidify a bunch of learning through side projects and my job. (Currently a Product Manager at Salesforce!)

Also, I believe that being able to write and document your thoughts in a impactful way is an important skill, and something I want to improve. I'm hoping this practice will lead to some better writing and deeper thoughts.

I'm looking to combine two passions (fitness + tech) into one cool content repo for myself to a) reflect on later, and b) if I'm lucky - produce some things that others may find interesting.

At the very least I have the domain name for my last name, so it's a win regardless.
